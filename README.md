### Notes & Communication

Apr 6th

Emma: There isn't much actual work done in the Rmd file yet, but I have the project data read in. I will start working on it bit by bit later this week, and will keep you updated! If you have any issues with using GitHub don't hesitant to let me know! Also, for convenience, always do a `git fetch` and `git pull` before you start working on the project to make sure you are alwasy working on the most up-to-date repo, saves you a bit of key strokes to merge if the remote branch is updated in between the time you are off ;-)
